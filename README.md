This repository has grown unmanageable enough that I've started a [second one](https://github.com/davidaramant/buddhabrot) for the tools to generate large Buddhabrots.

This one will keep all the semi-related stuff like making the diagrams for the [writeup](https://davidaramant.github.io/post/the-buddhabrot-part-1/).

_Some_ of the below is correct.

*********************************************

# Overview

A tool to generated Buddhabrot images.

# Usage

The application is running using a command-line program (`Fractals.Console.exe`).

There are several operations that are performed through those same applications.
To control which operation is done, switches are passed to the application:

Switch | Description
------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------
-t     | Controls the type of operation being performed
-c     | The path to the (XML) configuration file for the operation
-u     | (Optional) The number of logical processes to use for parallel operations

## Find Points

Operation Switch: `FindPoints`

Find Buddhabrot (or Mandlebrot) points using different point selection strategies.

Configuration File:

Argument             | Description
-------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OutputDirectory      | The location where the found points will be stored
OutputFilenamePrefix | The prefix for the output file names (a unique suffix will be added)
MinimumThreshold     | The minimum number of times a point must be valid to be included in the output
MaximumThreshold     | The maximum number of times to validate a point before giving up on it (i.e. bailout value)
SelectionStrategy    | The strategy to use when selecting the random points for evaluation
InputDirectory       | (If using an "edge" strategy) The directory containing the input file
InputEdgeFilename    | (If using an "edge" strategy) The filename containing the locations of the grids bordering the Mandelbrot set

### Buddhabrot Selection Strategies

Strategy               | Description
---------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Random                 | Generate a random complex number
BulbsExcluded          | Exclude the "bulbs" from the Mandelbrot set (these are known to not generate Buddhabrot points, computationally cheap)
EdgesWithBulbsExcluded | Only use points from the grids on the edge of the Mandelbrot (excluding the "bulbs")

### Mandelbrot Selection Strategies

Strategy               | Description
---------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Random                 | Generate a random complex number
BulbsOnly              | Only uses points within the "bulbs" from the Mandelbrot set (computationally cheap)
EdgesAndBulbsOnly      | Only use points from the grids on the edge of the Mandelbrot or within the "bulbs"

## Plot Points

Operation Switch: `PlotPoints`

Plot the Buddhabrot points for a specified number of iterations, tracking the hit count per location.

Argument             | Description
-------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution           | The resolution at which to plot the points (must match the rendering resolution)
Bailout              | The bailout value (how many iterations of the function to apply per point while tracking vectors)
InputDirectory       | The directory containing the input files
InputFilePattern     | The file pattern to use to find the input files (the list of points to plot)
OutputDirectory      | The location where the output file will be stored
OutputFilename       | The name of the output file containing the plotted point values

## Render Plot

Operation Switch: `RenderPlot`

Render the plotted points into an image.

Argument             | Description
-------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution           | The resolution at which to render the image
InputDirectory       | The directory containing the input file
InputFilename        | The name of the file containing the plotting results
OutputDirectory      | The location where the output file will be stored
OutputFilename       | The name of the rendered output file

## Render Points

Operation Switch: `RenderPoints`

Render the Mandlebrot points into an image.

Argument             | Description
-------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution           | The resolution at which to render the image
InputDirectory       | The directory containing the input file
InputFilename        | The name of the file containing the plotting results
OutputDirectory      | The location where the output file will be stored
OutputFilename       | The name of the rendered output file

## Find Edge Areas

Operation Switch: `FindEdgeAreas`

Find regions near the Mandlebrot set (that are more likely to have Buddhabrot points).

Argument             | Description
-------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution           | The resolution at which to search for points (recommended to not exceed 8192x8192)
Grid Size            | The size of a single side of a grid (out of a total size of 3.0)
OutputDirectory      | The location where the output file will be stored
OutputFilename       | The name of the output file

## Render Nebula Plots

Operation Switch: `RenderNebulaPlots`

Render three separate plots of points (generally gathered with different bailout values) into a multi-color image.

Argument             | Description
-------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution           | The resolution at which to render the image
InputDirectory       | The directory containing the input file
RedInputFilename     | The name of the file containing the plotting results to be used for the *red* channel
GreenInputFilename   | The name of the file containing the plotting results to be used for the *green* channel
BlueInputFilename    | The name of the file containing the plotting results to be used for the *blue* channel
OutputDirectory      | The location where the output file will be stored
OutputFilename       | The name of the rendered output file
